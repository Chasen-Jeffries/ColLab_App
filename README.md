# ColLab (Collaborative Laboratory)
ColLab is an application designed to boost collaborative research by creating a bulletin board style website where students and faculty can post ideas for projects, research, and articles that they are interested in collaborating on with others. It uses python to access the data for each post within a repository as well as allow users to create new posts that are added to the repository. Users can browse posts based on school, department, or key-word or they can use a search function to lookup specific ideas or topics. The application will provide the information in a user-friendly manner, likely a bulletin board style. Finally, users can create a simple profile with relevant information that allows establishing connections (friending or following).

### Project Requirements expressed as user stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to create and log in to my profile
  - I want to be able to write a brief biography about me and my research interests.
- As a user, I want to be able to post my research ideas that I would like to work on collaboratively.
  - I want to be able to post my research design
  - I want to be able to state the type of collaboration desired. (i.e. data wrangling, domain expertise, etc)
  - I want to be able to add keywords for my posts (to id the field, topic, etc)
- As a user, I want to be able to browse and search other collaborative research ideas that I align with my interests and skills.
  - Browse based on department, field, or keywords
  - Search based on topic, keyword, or field.
  - Look at my friends, peers, professors posts
- As a user, I want to be able to connect with and talk to potential collaborators.
  - I want to be able to friend or follow other users
- As a user, I want an easy-to-use interface that can be used with minimal experience.  

### Project Stakeholders:  
- Users: students, professors, and others interested in working collaboratively on research projects.
- Developers: Developers who will build the application.
- Database specialists: Database management skills will be required to help in storing and managing the posts created by users.
- Project Manager: Oversees the development process and coordinates between different components of the project.  
- UX/UI Designer: Design the interface to ensure an easy-to-use application that is user friendly for first time users.  

### Completion Times Estimates:
- Create an intuitive user-profile page: 1-2 weeks
- Create an easy-to-use mechanic that allows users to post: 1-2 weeks
- Implement a bulletin-board style browsing interface: 2 weeks
- Implement a search function for user posts: 1-2 week
- Implement a function to save or favorite posts: 1 week
- Testing and development: 2-3 weeks

#### Possible Additions:
- Idea Bank: A bank of additional ideas for projects, research, or problems that people havenâ€™t seen address. Individuals can post ideas they had, but do not necessarily want to work to give others the opportunity to answer those questions or solve those problems.
- Collarative Environment: Build a simple web/app environment that promotes easy collaboration between individuals on projects. This may include text or video messaging services, Git style collaborative tools, etc.
